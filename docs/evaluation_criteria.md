# Evaluation Criteria

This document outlines how submissions will be assessed during Hackocalypse. Evaluation is split into two categories: **Technical Assessment** and **Scenario Success.**

---

## **1. Technical Assessment (60%)**
This evaluates the technical accuracy, performance, and stability of your solution.

1. **Accuracy (20%)**
   - Retrieval of relevant map information and updates.
   - Correct handling of spatial and temporal context.

2. **Response Quality (20%)**
   - Clarity, relevance, and usefulness of survival plans.
   - Actionable insights based on available data.

3. **System Performance (10%)**
   - Response time under **5 seconds** for all queries.
   - Efficient data indexing and retrieval processes.

4. **System Stability (10%)**
   - Resilience under heavy input loads.
   - Ability to process multiple updates without failure.

## **2. Scenario Success (40%)**
This evaluates how effectively your system performs in various scenarios.

1. **Survival Strategies (20%)**
   - Effectiveness of plans in guiding survivors to safety.
   - Ability to adapt plans based on real-time updates.

2. **Threat Avoidance (10%)**
   - Tracking zombie movements and avoiding outbreak zones.
   - Generating safe escape routes dynamically.

3. **Resource Management (10%)**
   - Efficient allocation of limited supplies.
   - Balancing risk vs. reward in resource decisions.
