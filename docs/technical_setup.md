An API key is a unique code used to authenticate requests when accessing Groq's API. Here's a step-by-step guide to creating one.

---

## Step 1: Sign in to Your Groq Account
1. Open your web browser and go to the [Groq website](https://www.groq.com).
2. Click **Sign In** in the top-right corner of the homepage.
3. Enter your account credentials (email and password) to log in. If you donâ€™t have an account, click **Sign Up** to create one.

## Step 2: Navigate to API Settings
1. Once logged in, locate your account dashboard.  
   - Usually, this is accessible by clicking on your profile picture or username in the top-right corner.
2. In the dashboard or profile menu, find and click on **API Keys** or **Developer Settings**.

## Step 3: Generate a New API Key
1. Look for a button or option labeled **Create New API Key** or **Generate API Key**.
2. Provide a name for the key.  
   - For example, if youâ€™re using this key for a specific project, name it accordingly (e.g., *MyProjectAPIKey*).  
3. (Optional) Set permissions for the key, if applicable.  
   - Some APIs allow you to limit access (e.g., read-only, full access).  
4. Click **Generate** or **Create Key**.

## Step 4: Copy and Save Your API Key
1. Once the key is created, it will be displayed on the screen.  
   - **Important:** Copy it immediately as you might not be able to view it again.  
2. Store it securely in a password manager or a safe file.

## Tips for Security
- Never share your API key publicly (e.g., in code repositories or forums).  
- If you suspect your key has been compromised, revoke it from the **API Keys** section and generate a new one.

## **Test Your Setup**

To make sure everything is set up correctly, you can run the following command to verify that Groqâ€™s Python client is installed:
```python
python -c "import groq; print(groq.__version__)"
```
If you see the version number printed, youâ€™re all set to start coding!

## **Launch the Web Interface**

Run the application using Streamlit:
```python
streamlit run src/app.py
```
